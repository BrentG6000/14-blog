# 14-blog

## Description

This app is designed to be a blog site. In this site users are able to sign in and make blog posts. They can also make comments on other user's posts. By building this program I learned how to make
a web app using a mongodb database and handlebars mvc.

## Installation

To install this app simply download the code from this repo, open a terminal and run "npm i" in the root downloaded folder to install the needed node modules (you must have node installed on your system
to do this). Then run "npm run start" to begin the program. You can also try the live app at this website:
 
## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
